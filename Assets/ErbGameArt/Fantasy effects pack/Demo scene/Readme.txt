Pack includes 23 effect prefabs. 

NOTE:
All effects works in mobile but I don't recommend you to use effects with projectors in mobile.
You can delete post processing stack if you want. This won't affect the operation of the particle system (I use bloom).

Using effects:
Just drag and drop prefab of effect on scene and use that :)
